# TSYP RAS Challenge: Saferoad Enhancement Kit

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the IEEE ENSIT team's solution to the TSYP RAS Challenge. Our project focuses on providing a Saferoad Enhancement Kit, which is an attachable kit for vehicles aimed at enhancing connectivity and sensoring features.

## Contents

- **IEEE_ENSIT_TSYP_RAS.ino:** Arduino program file.
- **IEEE_ENSIT_TSYP_RAS.pdsprj:** Schematic design file.

## Project Overview

Our Saferoad Enhancement Kit is designed to improve road safety by enhancing the connectivity and sensor capabilities of vehicles. The Arduino program provides the intelligence to the kit, while the schematic design illustrates the hardware components and connections.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino program file (**IEEE_ENSIT_TSYP_RAS.ino**) using the Arduino IDE.
3. Explore the schematic design file (**IEEE_ENSIT_TSYP_RAS.pdsprj**) using your preferred PCB design tool to understand the hardware layout.

## Project Features

- Improved vehicle connectivity for data sharing and communication.
- Enhanced sensoring capabilities for better road awareness.
- Customizable and easy-to-install kit.
