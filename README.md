# IEEE_ENSIT_TSYP_RAS
Welcome to a vision of the future where vehicles and infrastructure converge in perfect harmony, shaping an ecosystem dedicated to safety and well-being for all road users.
In this narrative, we explore a world where collaboration between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure creates a new paradigm, redefining the road experience for everyone involved
our solution is to provide both a attachebale kit to vehicules in order to enhance its connectivity and sensoring features.
this will help us predict citical road situations and assit the driver. 
an other complementary feature is to help provide data bases via iot and cloud tehcnologies for other applications such as improving infrastructre, cars and vehicule manifucturing etc..
